# Pet Hospital Deployment Fix

This document explains the fixes applied to resolve deployment issues in the Pet Hospital Management System.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Frontend Nginx Configuration**:
   - Fixed nginx.conf to handle missing services (billing, insurance, visits, vets)
   - Added 501 responses for services that aren't implemented yet

2. **AWS Load Balancer Controller Permissions**:
   - Added missing `elasticloadbalancing:DescribeListenerAttributes` permission
   - Created a comprehensive IAM policy for the AWS Load Balancer Controller

3. **Kubernetes Manifest Image References**:
   - Fixed image references in deployment files to use the correct ECR URLs
   - Removed `${ECR_REPOSITORY_URL}` placeholders that were causing InvalidImageName errors

4. **AWS CNI IP Allocation**:
   - Added configuration to increase IP address allocation for the AWS CNI plugin
   - Prevents "failed to assign an IP address to container" errors

4. `./.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Updated with fixes for all issues
